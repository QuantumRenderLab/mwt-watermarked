# Mobile Web Texture (Watermarked)

This repository contains the **watermarked version** of **Mobile Web Texture**, allowing you to fully evaluate the asset before purchasing it on the Unity Asset Store.

**Mobile Web Texture** is a robust Unity solution that enables developers to render live web content—including **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**—directly onto Unity textures.

With its built-in input abstraction layer, the asset supports seamless pointer and touch interaction simulation across devices, delivering smooth and responsive user input for embedded web views.

The package supports **WebGL rendering**, **HTML5 video playback**, and **XR platforms**, and includes a lightweight **VR-optimized virtual keyboard**. This makes it easy to display and interact with fully functional web pages inside immersive VR environments.
